    "The client I will be working with is SportsStats, a sports analysis firm partnering with local news and elite personal trainers to provide insights to help their partners. They recognize patterns/trends highlighting certain groups, events, countries, etc. for the purpose of developing a news story or discovering key health insights. As someone with a personal history with several sports such as basketball, martial arts, fencing, bicycling, and more, being able to perform analysis to gain insights on sports is something that personally engages me. Additionally, I reside within a culture that is heavily influenced by health and well-being as an ideal to pursue, so I find that this analysis that will be able to provide key health insights will provide value not only to the client I will be working with in this project, but also to the general public as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Quality Assessment notebook provides the methodology and results for discovering issues with the raw data provided by SportsStats, and the Data Cleaning Procedure notebook provides the methodology for resolving most of the issues as well as access to cleaned versions of the datasets. The cleaned version of the dataset is precisely what I will be using for Surface Level Data Exploration to provide context for the dataset we will be working with in future analysis.\n",

Understanding from which environment you are working from is critical for your project, especially if you intend to replicate the steps provided. The code that will be provided after this step assumes you are working with a relative path to retrieve, load, and use CSV and DB files stored under the same folder as where this notebook would be saved. As such, make sure that your current working directory matches accordingly.\n",
