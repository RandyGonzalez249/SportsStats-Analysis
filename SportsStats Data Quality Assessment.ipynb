    "The client I will be working with is SportsStats, a sports analysis firm partnering with local news and elite personal trainers to provide insights to help their partners. They recognize patterns/trends highlighting certain groups, events, countries, etc. for the purpose of developing a news story or discovering key health insights. As someone with a personal history with several sports such as basketball, martial arts, fencing, bicycling, and more, being able to perform analysis to gain insights on sports is something that personally engages me. Additionally, I reside within a culture that is heavily influenced by health and well-being as an ideal to pursue, so I find that this analysis that will be able to provide key health insights will provide value not only to the client I will be working with in this project, but also to the general public as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "SportsStats has provided two related datasets, and the aim of this notebook will be to assess the quality of the data to better understand what needs to be cleaned before we can procede with analysis. The data consists of 120 years worth of data regarding the Olympics from 1896 to 2016, with a reference dataset consisting of various National Olympic Committee (or NOC) codes along with the regions they represent. The notebook here will not only provide what has been checked, but also how SQLite is used to discover some of the discrepancies. Note that more understanding from research is necessary to contextualize the discrepancies, and will be available through a separate appendix titled \"Olympics Research Appendix\".\n",

    "First, you may desire to understand, and potentially adjust your working directory. Understanding from which environment you are working from is critical for your project, especially if you intend to replicate the steps provided. The code that will be provided after this step assumes you are working with a relative path to retrieve, load, and use CSV and DB files stored under the same folder as where this notebook would be saved. As such, make sure that your current working directory matches accordingly.\n",

    "### Notes on Table Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two tables, ath_events with 15 columns, and noc_regions with 3 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Columns from ath_events with TEXT data: Name, Sex, Team, NOC, Games, Season, City, Sport, Event, Medal\n",
    "- Columns from ath_events with INTEGER data: ID, Year\n",
    "- Columns from ath_events with REAL data: Age, Height, Weight\n",
    "    - Note that the REAL data is representable wih decimal values, but the information only (if not mainly) consists of integer values. We will keep as is instead of potentially changing to integer to enable future calculations during analysis.\n",
    "- All columns from noc_regions are TEXT variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferences from First Look:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ath_events\n",
    "- We can partition the data uniquely with `ID`, `Games`, `Team`, and `Event`. The combination of those four help identify each observation.\n",
    "- Multiple copies of the same name can be found in the `Name` and `ID` columns, but this reflects upon different events and/or different years of the games. In other words, the structure of the data takes a long structure, where there would be less columns but more rows to represent the data.\n",
    "- The medal section appears to contain more Null values than other values such as Gold or Silver. That should mean that we have data on most, if not all of the participants of the games, not just those who won medals during those games, and if they did not receive a medal, their value is relegated to a Null value.\n",
    "- There are some occurances of Null values for height and weight, which may reflect in missing values due to lack of data as opposed to missing values by design of the data structure. We may be interested in replacing the Null values in the `Medals` column with another value representing not having a medal.\n",
    "- Upon inspection of the first ten observations, there seems to be a lack of data for `height` and `weight` only during the earlier years of the olympics, such as 1900 and 1920, when the dates of the games which occurred closer to 2000 contains `height` and `weight` data. It could be hypothesized that such data simply was not recorded at the time, and that records start to appear sometime in between the 1900s and the 2000s. Further exploration of the data will need to be made to confirm or challenge this hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### noc_regions \n",
    "- The values of `NOC` in this table seem to correspond with the `NOC` values of the `ath_events` data. Additionally, some values of `Region` in this table seem to correspond with some of the `Team` values of the `ath_events` data.\n",

    "\n",
    "## IV. Data Quality Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional Data Practices dictate that thorough diagnosis precedes remediation. As such, all columns will be checked systematically before implementing changes. This holistic assessment identifies interdependencies (e.g., Team names must align with NOC codes) and prevents redundant work. The following will be observed to verify data quality:\n",

    "The dataset that has been granted to us needs to correctly reflect real-world values. Checking whether or not each and every value that is listed in the database to be accurate would be a grueling task that is outside of the scope of work for this project. However, research on the origin of the dataset shows that it has been scraped from the website \"www.sports-reference.com\" in May 2018, according to this [Kaggle webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chadalee/olympics-data-cleaning-exploration-prediction) which states that the data was scraped and wrangled through R. From there, further research in the reviews of the company shows that the data they hold is accurate, and later exploration for data quality assessment will show that the data mostly aligns with data from other websites such as \"www.olympedia.org\".\n",

    "- There are no null values except in the columns of `Age`, `Height`, `Weight`, and `Medal`.\n",
    "- For the lack of some data for `Age`, `Height`, and `Weight`, considering that the data spans from before 1900 and ranges 120 years, there may have been a period of time where such information was never considered significant enough to warrant holding records for them until a certain time period when that sentiment changed. This is a hypothesis that will need further investigation to prove.\n",
    "- For the lack of data for `Medal`, considering that the amount of nulls covers almost all the observations, I am lead to believe that the reason null values exist is because in those circumstances, the person on record did not receive a medal for the event they participated in, and as such, was left empty for simplicity's sake. If this happens to be the case, it may be better to assign a value to represent that no medal was given rather than leaving it blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "About noc_regions:\n",
    "- There are no null values in the `NOC` column, but there are for `Region` and `notes`.\n",
    "- For the lack of data in `notes`, I surmise that notes were taken only when special circumstances should appear within the assignment between `NOC` and `Region` that warrant a needed explanation for clarification, and as such, the null values exist because in those moments, no notes were needed, similar to how the `Medal` column in `ath_events` has many null values that may suggest that no medals were given for those observations\n",

    "While Age 10 is the lowest age we have seen and appears for only one instance, there are many instances where ages close to 10 such as 11, 12, and 13 appear on records for the Olympics. Age 10 would not be considered an outlier outright. As for Age 97, we found that there is only one other instance of a person competing who is older than age 90, and that would be a man age 96. From there, the rest of the ages are 88 and below with no noticeable gaps past the age of 81 upon initial inspection. After inspecting the data, it is understood that older contestants competed in art competitions held by the Olympics, and as such, it starts to make sense that the events that require more skill and mental ability and less physical demand would allow for contestants of a far more varied age to participate. Once that gets taken into consideration, Age becomes a variable that falls within expectations, and we may wish to consider the correlation between age and sports/events in further analysis. Outlier analysis will be performed in another notebook describing data cleaning procedures.\n",

The rest of the temas have less than 20 attributed. We may wish to consider the circumstances of each of the teams and their relation to the NOC based in France. That being said, there are a few instances recorded where a supposed team referencing two different countries are on record for one specific NOC for France. I believe these specific team names referencing multiple countries may need to be explored further. When checking for the dual team, the format appears to always have a \"/\" in it, which means that you can use Regex that matches the whole string only if it contains \"/\"."

In researching the names of these specific NOCs, we find that both of them represent the country of Singapore, however for a period of time, one code was used over the other. This may explain the discrepancy within the data, and this is simply a circumstance where the code needs to be normalized. I may suggest changing SIN to SGP simply because there will be many obserevations holding SGP in ath_events data while the noc_regions data holds one record of SIN. It would be more resource-effective to change the one value in the smaller dataset rather than changing many over a large dataset. In terms of the validity of the dataset, it's accurate in terms of what the values represent according to real-world circumstances, but not exactly precisely accurate with which values are listed where.\n",

First, we will recognize that, if consistent, the Games text can be separated into two substrings where the first substring will always match the Year column (given that the Year is casted from Integer to Text) and the second substring will always match the Season column. We will test code that shows us circumstances when the first substring matches with Year and the second matches with Season. Then, we will filter to find any circumstances where the opposite is true, meaning that either the first subtring does not match with Year or the second does not match with Season.

Additionally, we note the existence of games in 1906 when there should only be games in the four year sequence of years 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, and so on. Research shows that the discrepancies we see here are in fact valid pieces of history that should stay on record. See Olympics Research Appendix for more information\n",

    "From what I could tell looking at the query of sports not listed in the Olympics.com list, any games where the most recent year was before 1950 can be considered an outdated game that potentially justifies why it is not being taken into consideration in Olympics.com. That being said, there are a multitude of sports listed in the dataset where they have been held within recent years yet not listed in Olympics.com. The reasoning behind this can be attributed to differences in naming schematics when it comes to categorizing sports in both the dataset and the list on Olympics.com.

    "- Having the number of events be 6192 while the number of gold medals is 13372, a little over double the number of events, is not 100% surprising considering team events are a common occurrence within the Olympics, and as such, the data takes into consideration the individual players that won the gold medals, even if they won it by participating as part of a team.\n",
    "- Having Gold be higher than both Silver and Bronze is not unsurprising considering there should always be a circumstance of first place within the competition\n",
    "- Having more Bronze medals exist over Silver medals is a noteworthy observation, however. The expectation of a competition should be that there are people who win silver medals before others win bronze medals, and yet the data seems to suggest otherwise. There are some explanations for the matter:\n",
    "    - The data is incomplete\n",
    "    - There are instances where two parties tie for bronze simply by the nature of a tournament bracket.\n",
    "    - There are some competitions that exist out there that function with a point-ranking system to award different colored medals so long as they are within a range of points rather than a relative-ranking system where awards are given to those who performed the best, the next best award goes to the next best performer, and so on and so forth.\n",

    "We cannot confirm that the data is completely valid as there is evidence to suggest otherwise.

As such, it will be noted as potential work to perform in the future, but for the meantime, for the purposes of analysis, we should treat the data as valid.\n",

    "There are several circumstances where the code is in reference to a specific part of the region as opposed to the region as a a whole such as CHN representing all of China with HKG representing Hong Kong of China. There exist a few circumstances of a code referring to a larger region that encompasses the main region in question, but is listed as the region because of how prominent it is compared to the whole, such as AUS representing Australia specifically with ANZ representing Australasia (Australia + New Zealand). Lastly, there are circumstances where the code used to represent the region simply changed over time, most likely due to changes within the region, such as URS representing not necessarily Russia but the Soviet Union (USSR), and RUS representing Russia as it is right now. This showcases enough precedent to hypothesize that the data is valid, with further exploration being something to consider for future work, but before we leave, earlier exploration showed null values for specific regions, so let's take a closer look:"

    "Looking at the only three NOCs that do not have a region, there are some things to note. First, ROT standing for Refugee Olympic Team makes sense as to why there is no specific region attributed to them. This effectively functions as a team that does not represent any particular region. UNK refering to Unknown feels like a placeholder for what is effectively a Null Value. We will want to see how many instances of UNK appearing within the original dataset, and if it is a low enough dataset, we can make it work for us. Last but not least, TUV is the NOC code that represents Tuvalu, from what I understand when looking at the adjacent notes. It doesn't seem consistent to have the region be stated in the notes but not in the region column. This will require ammendment in the cleaning stage."

Additionally, the further exploration of NOC values shows that there are very little unidentified NOCs, and as such, this warrants the ability to change what is effectively missing data to further complete the dataset. Last but not least, it was discovered by further observing the noc_regions dataset that the same region can be referred to by different names for different times, which is something we need to take into consideration when applying corrections to Singapore (SGP/SIN).\n",

    "### Dimension 4: Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at consistency, what we are really looking at is that there is a standardization of formats and naming conventions across the datasets. Most of the columns have this quality, with a fixed data type ensuring that formats stay consistent, and no misspellings nor renamings of the same value that would cause confusion and demand standardization. That being said, there are a few things to note about consistency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NOC has shown to be inconsistent with the various values for a particular region AND the misalignment with Singapore's NOC value. This is something that will need to be addressed when resolving the issues found here.\n",
    "- Team has also shown to be inconsistent with the names of the teams, especially with the case of the dual-region team names when they actually represent a specific region instead of two or more.\n",
    "- Any inconsistencies with the Year sequence has been addressed from research on the subject. The same applies for City. See Olympics Research Appendix.\n",
    "- In terms of consistency within the database, Sport has proven to stay consistent. That being said, when considering other data sources, many inconsistencies arise. It should be noted that while these exist, they do not have too great of an impact on the analysis of the dataset at hand.\n",
    "- Events column has too many distinct values to check whether the data is consistent or not. Will simply work with the assumption that the Events column is consistent, and leave the verification of this hypothesis for future work.\n",
    "- Medal is consistent in terms of distinct values and formatting, but not in terms of how many medals are distributed within any given event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension 5: Timeliness\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeliness simply refers to whether the data is up-to-date and relevant for its intended use. The data spans 120 years, but this span ends at 2016. It is late 2025 at the time of writing this, and as such, there are 2018 and 2022 Winter Games as well as 2020 and 2024 Summer Games we could incorporate into this dataset. That being said, the dataset was given to me for analysis purposes, and as such, I do not have the code nor the coding ability to rescrape the original website that hosted the data from the dataset to provide the updates necessary for analysis on more recent data. That being said, I believe 120 years worth of historical data will serve effectively for providing insights that would prove valuable to trainers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimension 6: Uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness refers to making sure that duplicates are avoided within the dataset that could skew analysis. We will analyze for any duplicates by observing the distinct rows of the dataset. Through earlier analysis, I was able to ascertain that noc_regions has no issues with uniqueness. Let's consider ath_events."
