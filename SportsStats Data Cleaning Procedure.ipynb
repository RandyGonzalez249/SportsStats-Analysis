    "The client I will be working with is SportsStats, a sports analysis firm partnering with local news and elite personal trainers to provide insights to help their partners. They recognize patterns/trends highlighting certain groups, events, countries, etc. for the purpose of developing a news story or discovering key health insights. As someone with a personal history with several sports such as basketball, martial arts, fencing, bicycling, and more, being able to perform analysis to gain insights on sports is something that personally engages me. Additionally, I reside within a culture that is heavily influenced by health and well-being as an ideal to pursue, so I find that this analysis that will be able to provide key health insights will provide value not only to the client I will be working with in this project, but also to the general public as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "SportsStats has provided two related datasets, and the notebook \"SportsStats Data Quality Assessment\" has identified the issues with the data. The data consists of 120 years worth of data regarding the Olympics from 1896 to 2016, with a reference dataset consisting of various National Olympic Committee (or NOC) codes along with the regions they represent. This notebook aims to correct the issues discovered, and will do so by using SQLite to alter the database that will host the raw datasets that will eventually become cleaned datasets ready for export and analysis. Note that more understanding from research is necessary to contextualize the discrepancies, and will be available through a separate appendix titled \"Olympics Research Appendix\".\n",

Understanding from which environment you are working from is critical for your project, especially if you intend to replicate the steps provided. The code that will be provided after this step assumes you are working with a relative path to retrieve, load, and use CSV and DB files stored under the same folder as where this notebook would be saved. As such, make sure that your current working directory matches accordingly.\n",

Pair that with the understanding that the Ottoman Empire dissolved in 1923, which means it is less likely to maintain records compared to the other nations/empires which dissolved later in the 20th century, and there is a decent chance that these participants hail from the Ottoman Empire. However, seeing as there doesn't exist a NOC code for them and that there isn't any feasible way to confirm this information, we can leave this as is.\n",

To start, we will work on each pairing one by one and understand where discrepancies may lie by cross referencing with Olympedia.org."

    "After seeing how many teams there are listed here in this query, researching through Olympedia (see Olympics Research Appendix) gave us the following insights for data cleaning for each dual team (Full team names are abbreviated for simplicity):\n",
    "\n",
    "- AUS/GBR: Team name should only represent Great Britain since Australia was under British rule until 1901, and the joint team was established in the 1896 games.\n",
    "- Barion/Bari-2: Team name should be changed to Bari to represent the only city on record for representation from this team.\n",
    "- BOH/GBR: Inaccuracy with Warden. Did not represent Great Britain but rather France. Was born in GBR, which explains discrepancy.\n",
    "- DEN/SWE: Records are accurate. No change.\n",
    "- GBR/FRA: Records are accurate. No change.\n",
    "- GER/USA: Records are accurate. No change.\n",
    "- GBR/GER: Records are accurate. No change.\n",
    "- Pannonia RC/National RC: Records are accurate. Change can be made, but is not suggested.\n",
    "- Pistoja/Firenze: Records are accurate. Change can be made, but is not suggested.\n",
    "- USA/FRA: Records are accurate. No change.\n",
    "- USA/GBR: Records are accurate for Tennis Mixed Doubles but not for Tennis Men's Doubles. Each participant in the \"USA/GBR\" team for that event actually represented two separate French tennis clubs, and then joined as one team both representing France. Team name and NOC must be changed.\n",

    "The biggest correction that needs to be made in terms of standardizations is the NOC columns when dealing with Singapore. Both SIN and SGP can be used as symbols to represent Singapore and are technically correct, but while research revealed that some years used SIN while others used SGP, ath_events shows that only one is used over the other while noc_regions uses another. If we wish to maintain historical accuracy, we would make the changes to account for both NOC codes. However, for the sake of future analysis, which may include geographical analysis based on NOC codes, it is more practical to standardize the formatting to make sure that only one code refers to the region in question. As such, we will change the code from noc_region since it is the most efficient option.\n"
